ITET net-scratch Terms of Use


- The ITET net scratch space is thought to temporarily store
  reproducible data or data for which a potential loss is manageable.
  It is not thought neither as a safe, nor as a backuped, nor as a
  long-term-storage filespace.

- Please note that the scratch space is *NOT* backed up. First this
  means, if you delete a file by accident, ISG.EE cannot recover it.
  Second, even though the scratch space is stored redundantly on a
  mirrored RAID system, and we try to offer best efforts to maintain
  proper operation, ISG.EE cannot be hold liable for any data
  losses on the system mentioned above. This includes, without claim of
  completeness, data loss due to technical reasons, accidental removal
  and the intentional automatic cleanup of data that has been unused
  for a longer period of time.

- As there are no limitations set on the net-scratch, a single user
  may actually allocate all of the available filespace. Please make
  sure you keep a reasonable amount of free space for other users
  and remove data you no longer need. ISG.EE reserves the right
  to remind users causing exhaustive filespace usage of their duty
  to keep some free space for other users.

- When your user account is removed, the netscratch directory will
  be removed as well, but the latter will not be archived.

- The service is only offered via NFS.
